# Stellar Evolution: Cosmic Clicker

A clicker/idle game where you evolve from cosmic dust to stars, solar systems, and eventually reshape the universe.

## Core Concept

You start with a small cloud of cosmic dust and through clicking, evolve it into stars, solar systems, galaxies, and eventually reshape the universe itself.

## Game Mechanics

- Begin by clicking to condense cosmic dust into a protostar
- As your star evolves, it generates different elements through nuclear fusion (passive income)
- Spend these elements to upgrade your star or create planets around it
- Each type of star (red dwarf, yellow star, blue giant, etc.) has unique properties
- Stars eventually die (creating supernovas or black holes) which gives massive resource boosts

## Progression Layers

1. **Stellar Layer** - Build and evolve individual stars
2. **Solar System Layer** - Create planets that provide unique bonuses
3. **Galactic Layer** - Manage multiple star systems
4. **Universal Layer** - Influence cosmic constants and laws of physics
